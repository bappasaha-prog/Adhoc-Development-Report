What the script does--?

Takes inputs

It asks you for a base folder path (example: C:\Exago)

And an output CSV file path (example: D:\Reports\status_scheduler_backup.csv)

Loops through client folders

Inside the base path, it goes through every folder (each one treated as a client folder).

Example:

D:\AT\BT\Client1
D:\AT\BT\Client2

Looks for a working folder inside each client folder

Example: D:\AT\BT\Client1\working

If the working folder is missing ‚Üí it logs an Exception into the CSV.

Scans for XML files inside working

If it finds .xml files ‚Üí it reads them and extracts data from specific tags:

schedule/report_type ‚Üí Schedule Type

jobinfo/Type ‚Üí Job Type

jobinfo/Status ‚Üí Job Status

Then it writes this info (along with client name, job ID, etc.) into the CSV as a Success row.

Handles missing XMLs

If the working folder exists but has no XML files, it logs a Skipped row into the CSV.

Creates a CSV report

The CSV contains a summary of all clients processed, with columns like:

client_folder | job_id | job_status | client | schedule_name | report_name | schedule_type | schedule_job_type | Recurrence | Type | status | details

üìä In short:

‚úÖ If XMLs exist ‚Üí parse and log job details.

‚ö†Ô∏è If working folder missing ‚Üí log exception.

‚ÑπÔ∏è If no XML files inside working ‚Üí log skipped.

Finally ‚Üí produces a consolidated CSV report for all clients.

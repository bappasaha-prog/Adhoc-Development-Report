This tool deletes files from a target folder (delete_from_folder) if their filenames match files found in a base folder.
It can handle both flat folders and folders with subdirectories.

How It Works

Collects all filenames from the base folder (with or without subfolders).

Looks inside the delete-from folder.

Deletes any file whose name matches one from the base folder.

Prints a summary of deleted and skipped files.

Enter:

Base folder path

Delete-from folder path


Run it by double-clicking file_cleaner.exe or from CMD:


Enter the base folder - where names of the xml are saved (maybe in a folder or in text file)
delete-from folder when prompted-loaction of destination pathe from where files will be deleted.

# README – Batch File for Distributing Parent XML Files

## Purpose
This batch script copies one or more **parent XML configuration files** into the **Config folders** of all Exago Scheduler instances (including `ExagoScheduler`).  
It ensures that all scheduler services share the same updated XML files.

---

## What You Need Before Running
1. **Parent XML Files**  
   - These are the files you want to distribute (e.g., `202500103.xml`).  
   - You must provide their **full file paths**.

2. **Exago Base Folder**  
   - The folder where Exago is installed (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Exago`).  
   - Inside this folder, there should be subfolders like:
     ```
     Client1-Scheduler
     Client2-Scheduler
     ExagoScheduler
     ```
   - Each of these contains a `Config` folder.

---

## How to Run
1. Save the script as `copy_parent_xmls.bat`.  
2. Double-click the `.bat` file (or run it from CMD).  
3. Provide inputs when prompted:
   ```
   Enter the full paths of the parent XML files (separated by space):
   C:\Files\202500103.xml C:\Files\202500104.xml

   Enter the schedule base folder path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Exago):
   C:\Program Files\Exago
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Copy each XML file into all `*-Scheduler\Config` folders under the base path.  
   - Also copy them into `ExagoScheduler\Config`.  

---

## Example Workflow

### Example Input
- Parent XML files:
  
  C:\Files\202500103.xml
  C:\Files\202500104.xml
  
- Exago base folder:
  
  C:\Program Files\Exago


### Example Folder Structure Before

C:\Program Files\Exago\
    Client1-Scheduler\Config\
    Client2-Scheduler\Config\
    ExagoScheduler\Config\


### Example Folder Structure After

C:\Program Files\Exago\
    Client1-Scheduler\Config\202500103.xml
    Client1-Scheduler\Config\202500104.xml
    Client2-Scheduler\Config\202500103.xml
    Client2-Scheduler\Config\202500104.xml
    ExagoScheduler\Config\202500103.xml
    ExagoScheduler\Config\202500104.xml

## Notes
- If a `Config` folder does not exist → that scheduler is skipped.  
- Existing files with the same name will be overwritten (`copy /Y`).  
- The script prints **SUCCESS** or **ERROR** for each copy attempt.  

✅ In short:  
This script takes parent XML files and **deploys them across all Exago Scheduler Config folders** in one go.

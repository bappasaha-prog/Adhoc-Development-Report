Explanation:

This bat file will stop the scheduler service mention inside the file

@echo off

Prevents commands from being displayed in the command prompt. Only output/results are shown.

net stop <ServiceName>

Stops a Windows service with the given name.

Example:

net stop Scheduler_AHHO_21053


This tries to stop the Windows service called Scheduler_AHHO_21053.

The script contains many such net stop commands, each targeting a different scheduler service (probably background schedulers for applications or processes).

pause

Keeps the Command Prompt window open after execution, showing messages like "The service was stopped successfully" or error messages if the service wasnâ€™t running.

In short:
This BAT file is designed to stop multiple Windows services (all starting with Scheduler_...) one by one, and then pause to let the user see the results.
